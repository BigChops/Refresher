## About Me
I am Sam Schlosser. I was born in Philadelphia, PA. I played football in highschool and was supposed to go to Rutgers to play on their offensive line but I tore my achilles in the final game of the season. 

I decided to try to go to a community college in Columbus, OH because both of my brothers were enrolled at Ohio State at the time and I was able to transfer to Ohio State for my 3rd semester. I did not enjoy traditional college so I dropped out.

My current career goals are to just make myself more employable and learn about my interests.
I chose FinTech because I felt like it was an exploding industry and wanted to learn more about blockchain and crypto currency and my brother sent me the information on this class and decided to enroll.
